# voicetovisual

Speak a word and visualize it on canvas. 



In this project, I am receiving voice input from the user, converting it to text and providing user an interface where he can visualise, color and draw the object.

The coloring functionality is available for fish and apple objects only due to data limitations. Though visualisations are available for any object.
