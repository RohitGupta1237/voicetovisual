# voicetovisual

Speak a word and visualize it on canvas. 

I tried hosting it as a web app using azure but I could not host it on Azure because mine is an interactive application which requires certain libraries which are not compatible with the available conceirge subscription. 

In this project, I am receiving voice input from the user, converting it to text and providing user an interface where he can visualise, color and draw the object.

The coloring functionality is available for fish and apple objects only due to data limitations. Though visualisations are available for any object.

I have uploaded a demo video frtProject.mp4 for your kind reference.
